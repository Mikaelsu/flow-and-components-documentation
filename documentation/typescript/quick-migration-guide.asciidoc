= Quick V14 to V15 Migration Guide

== Preparing a project manually [[preparing-a-project-manually]]

This guide describes step-by-step how to upgrade a Vaadin 14 application to Vaadin 15, and then shows how to add a TypeScript view to it.

→ *Step 1* - Make your project depend on Vaadin 15

.pom.xml
[source,bash]
----
<dependencyManagement>
    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>com.vaadin</groupId>
            <artifactId>vaadin-bom</artifactId>
            <!-- See the latest version at https://github.com/vaadin/platform/releases -->
            <version>15.0.0.alpha8</version>
            <type>pom</type>
            <scope>import</scope>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
</dependencyManagement>
----

[NOTE]
Vaadin 15 includes several breaking API changes, mainly related to application bootstrapping and the bootstrap page configuration.
If you see Java deprecation warnings during the build, check the <<client-side-bootstrapping#migrating-from-vaadin-10-14,Migration>> section in the *Client-side bootstrapping page*.

→ *Step 1b* - Update Spring (for Spring-based projects)

Vaadin works well with Spring, but it requires a compatible version of Spring.
For Vaadin 15 the compatible version of Spring is 5.2.0, and Spring boot 2.2.0.
If your application uses Spring, please update it to a compatible version:

.pom.xml
[source,bash]
----
<parent>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-parent</artifactId>
    <version>2.2.0.RELEASE</version>
</parent>
----

→ *Step 2* - Create `frontend/index.html` and `frontend/index.ts` to be able to add client-side <<client-side-routing#,client-side routes>>.

[NOTE]
These files are necessary only if you want to add TypeScript views to the app (new in Vaadin 15).
If you do not plan adding any TypeScript views, migration from Vaadin 14 to Vaadin 15 is done at this point.

You can create the `frontend/index.html` and `frontend/index.ts` files from scratch, but an easier way is to let Vaadin to generate them.
Run `mvn package` in the console, copy the generated files into to the `./frontend` folder, and customize them as described in the further steps.

[source, bash]
----
mvn package
cp target/index.html target/index.ts frontend
----

→ *Step 3* - Install link:https://lit-element.polymer-project.org/[LitElement^]

This step is needed if you want to create TypeScript views using LitElement as a helper library.
There are other ways to create UI in TypeScript, but they are not covered in this guide.

[source,bash]
----
$ npm install --save lit-element
----

→ *Step 4* - Define a Main Layout for navigation

This step is needed if you want to create a page layout common for several TypeScript views.
This guide shows how to create a layout with a navigation menu.

[NOTE]
Vaadin 15 allows seamless combinations of TypeScript and Java views, but it has a limitation.
Java views may be added freely as children into a TypeScript parent layout, but not the opposite.
TypeScript views cannot be added as children into a Java `RouterLayout` class.
If you need to add a TypeScript view into the same parent layout with existing Java views, then the layout has to be implemented in TypeScript.

.frontend/main-layout.ts
[source, javascript]
----
import {css, customElement, html, LitElement} from 'lit-element';

@customElement('main-layout')
export class MainLayoutElement extends LitElement {

  static get styles() {
    return css`
      :host {
        display: block;
      }
    `;
  }

  render() {
    return html`
      <a href="client-view">Client View</a>
      <a href="server-view">Server View</a>
      <slot></slot>
     `;
  }
}
----

Add the component to the router configuration:

.frontend/index.ts
[source, javascript]
----
import './main-layout';
...

const routes = [
    {
    path: '/',
    component: 'main-layout',
    children: [
      // add you client-side views here, e.g.
      // {path: 'client-view', component: 'my-client-view'},

      // pass all unmatched paths to server-side
      ...serverSideRoutes
    ]
  }
];
----


→ *Step 5* - Continue with the <<quick-start-guide#step-3,Quick Start Guide - Step 3>> to see how to add a client-side view.
